### Problem Statement:
The United Nations has become aware of the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), a score calculated by a research team at Yale to rate countries on their perceived environmental performance. They have contracted us to audit the EPI and determine if it can be useful in future endeavors, or if it contains any meaningful data. In order to evaluate the EPI we have decided to run models on the data that the EPI was calculated on. Using these models we were able to attack the problem from several different angles. Models were trained on the year to year scores, as well as on aggregate EPI data based on high or low EPI performing countries. We also added countries' Gross Domestic Product(GDP) to the data frame to determine if GDP would have an effect on EPI, or could be used to determine if certain indicators were more impactful in high or low GDP nations.

| Unsafe drinking water                           | We measure unsafe drinking water using the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons (DALY rate)  due to exposure to unsafe drinking water. A score of 100 indicates a country has among the lowest DALY rates in the world (≤5th-percentile),  while a score of 0 indicates a country is among the highest (≥95th-percentile). Data for this indicator come from the Institute for Health Metrics  & Evaluation’s (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. (EPI report 2020)                                                                                                                                | float | default               |
| PM2.5 Exposure                                  | We measure PM2.5 exposure using the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons (DALY rate) due to exposure to fine  air particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)A score of 100 indicates a country has among the lowest DALY rates in the world (≤1st-percentile),  while a score of 0 indicates a country is among the highest (≥99th-percentile). Data for this indicator come from the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation’s  (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. (EPI report 2020)                                                                                              | float | default               |
| Marine Protected Areas                          | We calculate the marine protected areas indicator as the percentage of a country’s total Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) lying within marine protected areas (MPAs).  MPAs represent a critical tool for protecting marine ecosystems from unsustainable fishing practices, pollution, and human disturbance. A score of 100  indicates that a country protects at least 10% of its total EEZ area, corresponding to Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Data  for this indicator come from the World Database on Protected Areas. (EPI report 2020)                                                                                 | float | default               |
| Wastewater Treatment                            | We measure wastewater treatment as the proportion of wastewater that undergoes at least primary treatment in each country, multiplied by the proportion  of the population connected to a wastewater collection system. A score of 100 indicates that a country has 100% of its population connected to a sewer system  and 100% of household wastewater is treated; a score of 0 indicates that no wastewater is reported as treated within a country. Data come from a wide variety of sources,  especially the UN Statistics Division, the OECD, and Eurostat. (EPI report 2020)                                                                       | float | default               |
| Water Resources                                 | The Water Resources issue category measures the extent to which humans are mitigating our threats to aquatic ecosystems. It is based on one  indicator: wastewater treatment.

| Fish Stock Status                               | Fish stock status is the percentage of a country’s total catch that comes from overexploited or collapsed stocks, considering all fish stocks within  a country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZs). Because continued and increased stock exploitation leads to smaller catches, this indicator sheds light  on the impact of a fishing practices within its EEZs. A score of 100 indicates that none a country's fish catch come from stocks that are overexploited or collapsed,  and a score of 0 indicates worst performance. Data come from the Sea Around Us. (EPI report 2020)                                                                       | float | default               |
| Terrestrial biome protection (national weights) | We derive the terrestrial biome protection indicator by first calculating the proportion of each biome in a country that lies within a protected area.  For the terrestrial biome protection (national weights) indicator, we then give greater weight to biomes that are relatively rare within a country –  and less weight to prevalent biomes – before aggregating the proportions. A score of 100 indicates that a country protects at least 17% of each of its biome types,  corresponding to Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Data for this indicator come from the World Database on Protected Areas. (EPI report 2020) | float | default               |
| Terrestrial biome protection (global weights)   | We derive the terrestrial biome protection indicator by first calculating the proportion of each biome in a country that lies within a protected area.  For the terrestrial biome protection (global weights) indicator, we then give greater weight to biomes that are relatively rare across the globe  – and less weight to prevalent biomes – before aggregating the proportions. A score of 100 indicates that a country protects at least 17% of each of its biome types,  corresponding to Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Data for this indicator come from the World Database on Protected Areas. (EPI report 2020)   | float | default               |
| Unsafe sanitation                               | We measure unsafe sanitation using the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons (DALY rate) due to their exposure  to inadequate sanitation facilities. A score of 100 indicates a country has among the lowest DALY rates in the world (≤5th-percentile),  while a score of 0 indicates a country is among the highest (≥95th-percentile). Data for this indicator come from the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation’s (IHME)  Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.

### Background Research:
The Environmental Performance Index is a method of quantifying and numerically marking the environmental performance of a state's policies. We are combining science and social matters to identify global challenges. EPI has a pivotal role because the environmental policy requires data and analytics rigor to become efficient and effective. 

### Evidence and Analysis:
Looking at the top and bottom country performance for EPI we can determine that the EPI has some skewness in the way it is calculated regarding high performance and low performance countries. Many of the features that have the highest importance for predicting the EPI for top performing countries, especially those surrounding water infrastructure do not have the same impact on the bottom countries. Using different model types still confirms that these features are often a better predictor for the top performing countries. These features are Wastewater treatment and unsafe drinking water. 
From our year-by-year analysis we can conclude that the current weighting of the EPI is not a good representative of the factors that are used to calculate its value. The calculation of EPI changes on a bi-yearly basis, but the features that most accurately determined the EPI in the models were maintained from year to year. Additionally, water and sanitation features were over-represented in both model weight percentage and feature importance.

Moving forward with the project we would like to be able to address a more in-depth analysis of the features and their specific weights, as well as expand on the GDP information. Using per-capita GDP, along with different model types could allow us to discover new insights that were missed in our prior analysis. We imagine this is a good baseline project into evaluating the effectiveness of the EPI and the way the features interact with one another. 

### Conclusions and Recommendations:
After reviewing the EPI and using several models to evaluate the features we recommend that the UN avoid using the EPI as a single resource for environmental performance. 

The EPI is somewhat volatile in what attributes are used to calculate it, and overall it still needs weight adjustment to accurately represent the environmental data it is named after. Currently it focuses overly on health, water, and sanitation metrics.

Overall, it is not a metric that we would recommend for use in the realm of global policy making.

### Executive Summary:
Environmental health is at the forefront of major global issues to be addressed in our time. As such, it is important to identify metrics that are scientifically backed and universally applicable in order for policy makers to be capable of making informed and data driven decisions in the environmental sphere.

Our project set out to use machine learning models to verify if the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is one such metric. The EPI report is created by a research team at Yale, and represents a weighted aggregate of many important environmental and health factors.

We found that in modeling the EPI, it did not entirely stand up to scrutiny as an environmental metric. It is recalculated every two years with different sets of features, making it highly variant for policy making. Additionally, it has a tendency to overrepresent sanitation and water related metrics, while somewhat lacking on accurate environmental ones.

It is important in the global struggle against human-related climate change that policy is driven by useful, consistent data about environmental health. The EPI, as analyzed over the course of 19 years, may not be that metric. Continued research is needed to find lower variance and accurately weighted environmental performance indicators.
